                My name is Arturo Diaz Allca, I was born in Lima - Peru and I'm bachelor of Systems Engineering at
                Universidad de Lima. I'm passionate about programming different kind of applications, specifically
                recreating in the website some videogames that are popular around the world. Currently I'm working like
                frontend developer since december at 2020, but sometimes I have to write some code in the backend and it
                honestly feels great to know that little by little I will be able to become a fullstack :)
                <br><br>
                I hope to keep working like a developer more time, because I feel like I can learn a lot more about this
                world, and why not, become an experienced fullstack developer or grow up in my professional career.
